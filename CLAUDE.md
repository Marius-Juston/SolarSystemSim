# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

Dependencies are managed with `uv` (see `uv.lock`, `pyproject.toml`; requires Python >= 3.13, deps are just numpy +
matplotlib).

- Install / sync env: `uv sync`
- Run sanity regression checks: `uv run python test_sanity.py` — this is a **plain script with print + assert
  statements, not pytest**. It prints computed vs. published reference values; there is no test runner and no
  single-test selector. Inspect output visually. New solar-system / moon / habitability code adds **additive asserts
  in "section 9"** — keep older pinned values unchanged.
- 10-system PHZ demo (static PNGs + MP4s): `uv run python demo.py`
- Random full solar-system generator (1-, 2-, 3-star, with moons + habitability + nested N-body stability):
  `uv run python generate_solar_system.py [seed]`
- Photorealistic ground-to-sky renderer (single / binary / triple sky): `uv run python render_skyview.py [seed]`
- Stateful photosphere field (granulation + sunspots, equirect + disk PNG + MP4):
  `uv run python render_photosphere.py [seed] [mass_msun] [res] [line]` — research/sun_render.md Phase 2.
- Photosphere diagnostics / measured-data validation (Sun, hot blue star, M dwarf; zoom
  crops, RMS-contrast / fill-factor / power-spectrum / limb-darkening plots, measured-vs-
  rendered PASS/FAIL table): `uv run python diagnostics_photosphere.py [dev|med]` →
  `figures/photosphere/diagnostics/`.
- All drivers write **repo-relative** to `figures/` and `animations/` (the old hardcoded `/home/claude/...` path is
  gone). **MP4 rendering requires `ffmpeg` on PATH**; drivers set `matplotlib.use("Agg")` and gracefully skip MP4s if
  ffmpeg is absent.
- `main.py` is a stub placeholder — not a real entry point.

### Acceleration / parallelism

The rendering + N-body kernels run through a single backend seam so the same code path works on
multi-GPU, single-GPU and CPU-only machines:

- `goldilocks/backend.py` — `xp` is NumPy or CuPy. Selected by `GOLDILOCKS_BACKEND=auto|cpu|gpu`
  (default `auto`: CuPy iff it imports and a CUDA device exists). Optional extras:
  `uv sync --extra gpu` (CuPy; pick the wheel matching your CUDA — `cupy-cuda12x`/`cupy-cuda11x`),
  `--extra accel` (numba), `--extra warp` (NVIDIA Warp). The CPU/NumPy path is byte-identical to
  before, so every pinned sanity value is preserved.
- `goldilocks/photosphere.py` — stateful equirectangular photosphere (curl-noise
  semi-Lagrangian advection + sunspots). Two interchangeable step backends behind one interface,
  chosen by `GOLDILOCKS_PHOTOSPHERE_BACKEND=auto|warp|reference` (default `auto`): a fused
  **Warp `@wp.kernel`** (`wp.curlnoise`) that JIT-compiles to CPU *or* CUDA — the efficient path
  on the multi-GPU box, still verifiable CPU-only — and a dependency-free NumPy/CuPy seam
  (fallback + correctness oracle). The two backends agree statistically, not bit-for-bit
  (asserted in section 9). **Resolution-safe:** granule wavenumber tracks the physical
  `R*/1 Mm` value clamped only to keep `>=` a min px/cell (higher res = more detail of the
  same scene, never aliased), while the advecting-flow and sunspot wavenumbers are fixed
  physical low frequencies (same motion/spot size at every preset). Granule-lifetime rate
  scales `Ro^-1/2`. The granule field is **Worley/cellular**
  (`noise.granulation_field`: bright convection cells + dark intergranular lanes;
  `noise.py` also has `simplex_noise_3d`, `fbm3`, `domain_warp3`, `worley_noise_3d`).
  `disk_image` bilinear-samples and applies a self-emissive **relief** (bump) shade so the
  surface is corrugated, not flat; a warm-balanced black-body LUT (the shared `skyview`
  ACES path desaturates the ~5772 K white to grey) gives a bright warm-white disk; spots
  carry DKIST-faithful **umbral dots** + **filamentary penumbra**, with a photospheric
  **Evershed** outflow in the penumbra (reference oracle). A Dravins convective blueshift
  tints the colour path only (`temperature()` stays raw, so determinism/parity are
  unaffected); a quantitative **DKIST validation** (RMS contrast / fill factor) is in
  `test_sanity.py` section-9.
  Driven by `render_photosphere.py`; not wired into the stateless pool disk renderer.
- Gravity darkening + stellar geometry (Phase 3): `StellarState` exposes `omega_rad_s`,
  `roche_f`, `omega_ratio`, `oblateness` (Roche, Maeder 1999). `starsurface.py` has
  `gravity_darkening_factor` (**Espinosa-Lara & Rieutord 2011** unconditionally, with a
  `β_gd/0.25` convective attenuation; von Zeipel only for the comparison test),
  `limb_darkening_law` (quadratic/eddington/claret4) and `ld_flux_factor`. `disk_image`
  Roche-deforms the silhouette and takes per-pixel μ from the surface normal when
  `oblateness>1e-3`; all of it is colour/geometry-only so the slow-rotating Sun and every
  pinned value are unchanged.
- Chromosphere / transition region (Phase 4): `goldilocks/chromosphere.py`
  (`emission_line_rgb`, `inverse_evershed_kms`, `chromosphere_overlay`) +
  `StellarState.{pressure_scale_height_m, chromosphere_thickness_rel, chromo_activity}`.
  An offline physics layer: shell thickness from the pressure scale height, optically-thin
  limb brightening `E∝(1−μ)^p`, Rossby-gated spicule fringe (log-normal heights), inverse
  Evershed inflow, emission-line colour via the CIE pipeline. Selected by
  `disk_image(emission_line=...)` / `render_photosphere.py [seed] [mass] [res] [line]`;
  `None` is a strict no-op (bolometric Sun byte-identical).
- `goldilocks/parallel.py` — work distribution + `encode_frames` (frames streamed straight into one
  `ffmpeg`, no `FuncAnimation`). One worker process per GPU (pinned via `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`), or
  a CPU process pool. `GOLDILOCKS_SERIAL=1` forces an in-process serial map (debug);
  `GOLDILOCKS_MAX_WORKERS=N` caps the CPU pool.
- `skyview.py` uses a Bruneton-2016-style precomputed optical-depth LUT (`_od_table`, lru-cached per
  atmosphere) instead of ray-marching every light ray per pixel — same look (LUT-vs-ray-march
  parity asserted in section 9), much faster on CPU and GPU. Default render resolutions were
  raised (phases 1920×1080, day-MP4 1280×720).
- `skyview.render_phases`/`animate_day` fan frames across the pool; `demo.py` fans whole systems
  across the pool; `animation.py` streams its (stateful-trail) draw loop into `encode_frames`.
- Two showcase systems in `random_systems.py`: `big_moon_system` (a moon ~8× the apparent size of
  the real Moon) and `companion_with_moon_system` (a co-orbital giant + its own large moon, both
  prominent in the observer's sky). Both are wired into `render_skyview.py`; the first is also a
  `demo.py` entry.

## Architecture

Single Python package `goldilocks/` (import as `from goldilocks.<module> import ...`). It computes the **Permanently
Habitable Zone (PHZ)** for single/binary/hierarchical-triple star systems, packs planets into the stable zone, generates
full random solar systems (moons, habitability), verifies stability with nested N-body, and renders static + animated +
photorealistic-sky output. `README.md` has the physics background/formulae/citations; `ROADMAP.md` tracks the
random-solar-system feature phases. Read both for algorithm-level work.

### Layering (lower layers have no dependence on higher ones)

1. **Physics primitives** — pure, independently testable:
    - `stellar.py` — `Star` dataclass; Eker 2018 mass→luminosity/radius/T_eff.
    - `stellar_state.py` — L0 `StellarState` (research/sun_render.md Phase 1): frozen,
      `__post_init__`-validated; derives B-V (Ballesteros LUT), Skumanich P_rot (with a
      young-star saturated plateau), Noyes τ_c, Rossby, gravity-darkening β, tidal lock;
      `spectral_class` (O/B/A/F/G/K/M). Feeds `starsurface`/`photosphere`.
    - `kepler.py` — closed-form 2-body Kepler solver, `orbital_period`.
    - `habitable_zone.py` — Kopparapu HZ flux limits, Mueller-Haghighipour multi-star weighted flux.
    - `stability.py` — Holman-Wiegert S/P-type cuts, Mardling-Aarseth triple stability, Hill-radius planet packing.
    - `roche.py` — Eggleton 1983 Roche-lobe geometry.
    - `secular.py` — Heppenheimer / Leung-Lee forced eccentricity, Laplace-Lagrange secular coupling.

2. **Orchestration** — `system.py` (`StarSystem`): keystone class tying primitives together. Constructed via
   `StarSystem.single/binary/hierarchical_triple`. Places stars on analytical Kepler orbits, computes combined PHZ,
   applies stability + Roche cuts, packs planets with secular coupling. `summary()` produces the text report.

3. **Bodies & catalogues**:
    - `planets.py` — `Planet` objects (incl. `moons`, `habitability`, `inclination_deg`, `bulk_density_gcc`,
      `is_gas_giant`) + real-system catalogue (Kepler-16/34/35/38/47, `earth_analog`).
    - `moons.py` — `Moon` dataclass; fluid Roche limit; Domingos+2006 critical Hill fraction; `generate_moons` (
      terrestrial 0–2, giants dozens–100+; Roche + Hill + mutual-Hill validated).
    - `random_systems.py` — generators for synthetic regimes (star-hopper, Trojan, wide hierarchy, polar planet).
    - `solar_system.py` — `random_solar_system`: Raghavan-2010 multiplicity PMF (56/33/8/3%); 4+-star systems collapse
      the outer node into one effective `Star` so triple dynamics stay valid; snow-line placement, mutual-Hill spacing,
      forced ≥1 PHZ terrestrial, retry loop.
    - `habitability.py` — `HabitabilityProfile` + `profile_for_planet`: gravity, insolation/T_eq, rotation, day/night,
      obliquity/seasons, magnetosphere, atmosphere + sky color, biosphere score. Each field from a published scaling
      law.

4. **Dynamics**:
    - `nbody.py` — stars on analytical Kepler orbits, planets integrated numerically (leapfrog, adaptive sub-stepping).
      Source of non-Keplerian planet motion in animations.
    - `nbody_moons.py` — nested KDK leapfrog (stars analytic, planets + moons numeric); vectorized all-pairs;
      osculating-element stability report separating secular drift from bounded libration.

5. **Output** (depends on everything above; touches no physics primitive, pins no sanity value):
    - `visualization.py` — `plot_system`: multi-panel static figure.
    - `animation.py` — `animate_system`: MP4 driven by `nbody` with moving phase-dependent HZ contours.
    - `viz_solar_system.py` — overview PNG, per-planet zoom cards, long-term stability PNG, system MP4.
    - `skyview.py` — single-scattering atmospheric RT (Nishita 1993); arbitrary stellar Planck spectra, atmosphere from
      `HabitabilityProfile`, any number of suns, CIE-XYZ→sRGB→ACES tone-map. `render_phases` + `animate_day`.

    - `photosphere.py` — stateful equirectangular photosphere field (research/sun_render.md
      Phase 2); dual Warp/NumPy backend; consumes `StarSurface`/`StellarState` (Ro, spots,
      butterfly latitude, active longitude, Teff). Stateful, so it sits behind its own driver.

6. **Drivers** — `demo.py` (10 PHZ systems), `generate_solar_system.py`, `render_skyview.py`,
   `render_photosphere.py`, `test_sanity.py`.

### Key conventions

- Units: AU, years, solar masses/luminosities throughout; angles in degrees at API boundaries.
- A `StarSystem` whose binary separation dwarfs any HZ emits a warning and is treated as effectively independent —
  preserve this when touching `system.py`/`stability.py`. Drivers pass `quiet=True` to suppress that warning where
  expected.
- 4+-star systems are modelled as a hierarchical triple with a collapsed effective outer `Star` (Σmass, ΣL, L-weighted
  Teff); the original count is recorded in `system.generation_note`.
- When changing any physics primitive, check the corresponding pinned reference value in `test_sanity.py` (and its
  section-9 additive asserts) still matches. Core primitives are deliberately kept untouched by the solar-system feature
  so all pinned values are preserved.
